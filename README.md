# Energy-Efficiency
The data science project utilises machine learning techniques in order to predict  cooling energy consumption in residential buildings based on various building parameters.
The model will be trained on a dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes parameters such as relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area,
overall height, orientation, glazing area, and glazing area distribution.
The machine learning model will learn the complex relationships between these parameters and the cooling load of a building. Once trained, the model can predict the cooling load for a given set of building parameters. This prediction can provide valuable insights into how different parameters affect the cooling load, enabling us to identify key factors that contribute to high energy consumption
